# WP-Ultra-MCP — Feature Roadmap (Master List)

Current: **v0.13.0 · 151 abilities** (Waves 1–11 shipped: core, hubs+sandbox, full Elementor arc, Gutenberg, WooCommerce, SEO, custom fields, content core, site ops + FSE, forms + audits, ecosystem).

This is the complete candidate list for what comes next. Items are numbered for easy reference — pick a number, it becomes a wave/plan.

**Recommended order:** `1 → 7 → 12 → 2 → 8`

**Progress tracking:** tick the `[ ]` boxes right here in the file, **or** run `node docs/roadmap-tracker.mjs` and open <http://localhost:4488> — click a task to mark it complete (strikethrough); every click writes back to this file, so the file stays the single source of truth.

## 🏗️ Platform Power (makes the plugin itself stronger)

- [x] ~~**1 · `self-update`**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.14.0. GitHub release check + confirm-gated in-place update (API-403 redirect fallback) + native wp-admin Plugins-page update UI. Both live sites self-updated to 0.14.0 via the new ability.
- [x] ~~**2 · Async job runner (`job-start` / `job-status` / `job-list` / `job-cancel`)**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.15.0. WP-Cron slice-per-tick (loopback-kicked); built-in types search-replace / bulk-post-meta / site-audit; confirm-gated, cancellable, filterable registry. Verified end-to-end on a live site (real cron processed a site-audit to done).
- [x] ~~**3 · Universal undo / rollback**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.16.0. Auto-snapshot ring buffer before option-set / custom-css / theme.json / term-update; `undo-list` / `undo-restore` / `undo-last`. Absent-sentinel undoes a newly-created option by deleting it. Live round-trip verified in production.
- [x] ~~**4 · Recipe playbooks (multi-step)**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.17.0. `playbook-run` / `playbook-save` / `playbook-list` / `playbook-delete` chain many abilities; `{input.*}` + `{steps.<save_as>.<path>}` token passing (lone token keeps type); dry-run, continue-on-error, saved playbooks, no-nesting guard. Verified live in production (create → publish via captured id).
- [x] ~~**5 · Webhook / event triggers**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.18.0. `trigger-create` / `trigger-list` / `trigger-delete` / `trigger-log` on post/comment/user/Woo-order/form events → webhook (HMAC) / auto-playbook / log. Async via WP-Cron. Verified live in production (real publish → trigger logged).
- [x] ~~**6 · Rate-limits + per-ability roles**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.19.0. `manage-access` (admin-only) grants non-admin roles a limited ability/category set + per-minute rate limits (per ability/category/default). Two-layer: relaxed baseline + per-ability gate on `wp_before_execute_ability`. Live-verified. **Entire Platform Power tier (#1-#6) complete.**

## 🎨 Builders

Live 10-step chain verified on real WP; schema introspection awaits a live Bricks install. **🎨 Builders tier (#7–#11) COMPLETE.**
- [x] ~~**8 · `create-atomic-widget`**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.20.0. Declarative spec → real Elementor v4 atomic widget (PHP+Twig+CSS, element type `wpu-<name>`), correct-by-construction + crash-quarantined. Live-verified: minted → registered → placed → rendered (0 drops) → quarantine/regen cycle proven.
- [x] ~~**9 · `elementor-clone-url`**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.21.0. One call: AI brief (or static-URL auto-extract) → tokens + adaptive blueprint sections + section colors via global classes + strict validation + atomic write + render-check. Live-verified: 26/26 nodes rendered, 0 dropped.
- [x] ~~**10 · Elementor Pro surface**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.22.0. `elementor-pro-status` / `elementor-manage-library` (theme-builder templates + display conditions) / `elementor-manage-popup` (friendly triggers → native settings) / `elementor-form-submissions` (e_submissions reader). Verified against live Pro 4.1.2 in production (create→conditions→delete cycle + real submissions read).
- [x] ~~**11 · Divi / Beaver Builder / Oxygen foundation**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED v0.23.0. Unified `pagebuilder-status/get-content/set-content/list-elements` adapter domain: Divi shortcode parser/serializer (round-trip tested), Beaver flat-node↔tree with validation, Oxygen 4 JSON trees. **Builders tier (#7–#11) — #7 Bricks deep বাদে সব done.**
